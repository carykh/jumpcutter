# jumpcutter
Automatically edits videos. Explanation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw

Go here for a more polished version of this software that my friends and I have been working on fr the last year or so: https://jumpcutter.com/

Since my GitHub is more like a dumping ground or personal journal, I'm not going to be actively updating this GitHub repo. But if you do want a version of jumpcutter that is actively being worked on, please do check on the version at https://jumpcutter.com/! There's way more developers fixing bugs and adding new features to that tool, and there's a developer's Discord server to discuss anything JC-related, so go check it out!

## Some heads-up:

It uses Python 3.

It works on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10. (It might work on other OSs too, we just haven't tested it yet.)

This program relies heavily on ffmpeg. It will start subprocesses that call ffmpeg, so be aware of that!

As the program runs, it saves every frame of the video as an image file in a
temporary folder. If your video is long, this could take a LOT of space.
I have processed 17-minute videos completely fine, but be wary if you're gonna go longer.

I want to use pyinstaller to turn this into an executable, so non-techy people
can use it EVEN IF they don't have Python and all those libraries. Jabrils 
recommended this to me. However, my pyinstaller build did not work. :( HELP

## Building with nix
`nix-build` to get a script with all the libraries and ffmpeg, `nix-build -A bundle` to get a single binary.

## Usage with Docker
Build:
```
docker build . -t jumpcutter
```
Bind the directory to contain the videos to `/video`.

Easiest example where `in.mp4` and `out.mp4` are both in your current directory:
```
docker run -v $(pwd):/video jumpcutter --input_file in.mp4 --output_file new.mp4
```
This will work on any operating system as long as docker is installed.
